# Guessing Game

## Directions
### Step 1: Write Psuedo Code
Sample psuedo code in the Python Programming Language is as follows:

#program greeting
#program asks user to input a number for the range of the random number
#computer generates a random number between 1 and 100 
#computer tells user if guess is too high or too low
#if user guess is too high, program prints "Too high. Guess again."
#if user guess is too low, program prints "Too low. Guess again."
#if user guess is correct, program prints "You got it! The number was " + number 

### Step 2: Create Program Greeting (optional)
The program should greet the user, welcoming them to the game and giving game instructions. The program should print messages that welcomes the user and gives them game instructions.

### Step 3: Program Generates Random Number
The program should generate a random number using random.randint() and stores the random number in a variable. The program should include user input and the random.randint() method.

### Step 4: User Guesses Random Number
### Step 5: Program compares user guess to generated random number
### Step 6: Program prints comparison
### Step 7: User guesses again
### Step 8: Repeat steps 6-8 until correct guess 
### Step 9: Print congradulations message
### Step 10: Ask user if they would like to play again
